## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report:
1. Check existing [Issues](https://github.com/kohanmathers/quill/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. Update to the latest version and see if the bug persists
3. Collect relevant information (server version, Quill version, error logs)

When filing a bug report, include:
- **Description** - Clear and concise summary of the bug
- **Steps to Reproduce** - Minimal steps to trigger the bug
- **Expected Behavior** - What should happen
- **Actual Behavior** - What actually happens
- **Environment** - Server version, Quill version, Java version
- **Logs** - Relevant error messages or stack traces
- **Script** - The Quill script that causes the issue (if applicable)

### Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! When suggesting a feature:
- Explain the **use case** - what problem does it solve?
- Provide **examples** - show how it would be used
- Consider **scope** - does it fit Quill's philosophy?
- Check if it's **already planned** in the [Roadmap](README.md#roadmap)

### Contributing Code

#### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kohammathers/quill.git
   cd quill
   ```
3. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Development Setup

```bash
# Run tests
mvn test

# Create a plugin JAR
mvn clean package
```

#### Code Style

- **Java 21** features are encouraged
- **4 spaces** for indentation (no tabs)
- **Clear naming** - descriptive variable and method names
- **Comments** - explain *why*, not *what*
- **Test coverage** - add tests for new features

Follow standard Java conventions:
```java
public class ExampleClass {
    private String fieldName;
    
    public void methodName(String paramName) {
        if (condition) {
            // Do something
        }
    }
}
```

#### Testing

- Unit tests are encouraged but not enforced, I will forget to write them myself
- Test with a real Minecraft server when possible

#### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add support for custom event triggers

- Implement trigger_custom() built-in function
- Add CustomEvent handler to event bridge
- Update documentation with examples
```

Format:
- **First line**: Brief summary (50 chars or less)
- **Body**: Detailed explanation if needed
- **Reference issues**: Use `Fixes #123` or `Relates to #456`

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** - README, SPEC.md, or inline docs if needed
2. **Add tests** - Ensure your changes are tested
3. **Update changelog** - Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if it exists)
4. **Lint your code** - Run `./gradlew check`
5. **Create the PR** with a clear description:
   - What does this PR do?
   - Why is this change needed?
   - How has it been tested?
   - Screenshots/examples if applicable

**PR Checklist:**
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests added/updated and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes (or clearly documented if necessary)
- [ ] Commits are clear and well-organized

### Contributing Documentation

Documentation contributions are highly valued! You can help by:
- Fixing typos or unclear explanations
- Adding examples and tutorials
- Improving API documentation
- Translating documentation *(future)*

### Key Design Principles

1. **Safety First** - All scripts run in sandboxes with permission controls
2. **Simple Syntax** - Readable by non-programmers
3. **Event-Driven** - Natural fit for Minecraft's event model
4. **Performance** - Scripts should be fast and not lag the server
5. **Debuggable** - Clear error messages and logging

### Adding Built-in Functions

When adding a new built-in function:

1. Add to `functions/` package
2. Register in `FunctionRegistry`
3. Update `SPEC.md` with documentation
4. Add test coverage
5. Consider permission implications

Example:
```java
@BuiltInFunction("my_function")
public class MyFunction implements QuillFunction {
    @Override
    public Object execute(List<Object> args, ScopeContext context) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Adding Event Handlers

When adding a new event type:

1. Add to `events/` package
2. Create Bukkit event listener
3. Bridge to Quill interpreter
4. Update `SPEC.md` with event documentation
5. Add examples
