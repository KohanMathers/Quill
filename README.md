# Quill

A sandboxed scripting language for Minecraft event automation. Create community-run events without bugging your admins.

## What is Quill?

Quill is a simple, event-driven scripting language designed for Minecraft servers. It allows players to create custom game modes, mini-games, and automated events within sandboxed scopes ‚Äî all without requiring admin intervention for every command block.

### Key Features

- üéØ **Event-Driven** - React to player actions, block changes, and world events
- üîí **Sandboxed** - Scripts run in isolated scopes with physical boundaries
- üéÆ **Player-Friendly** - Simple syntax designed for non-programmers
- üõ°Ô∏è **Permission-Controlled** - Admins can revoke specific functions per scope
- üíæ **Persistent** - State and variables survive server restarts
- ‚úçÔ∏è **In-Game Editor** - Write and test code directly in Minecraft

## Quick Example

```
// Create an arena
let arena = new Scope(-50, 60, -50, 50, 100, 50)
arena.define(game_active, false)

// Start game on chat command
OnEvent(PlayerChat) {
    if chat.message == "!start" {
        arena.game_active = true
        broadcast("Game starting!")
        
        for player in arena.players {
            set_gamemode(player, "survival")
            give(player, "minecraft:stone_sword")
            teleport(player, 0, 65, 0)
        }
    }
}

// Handle player deaths
OnEvent(PlayerDeath) {
    if arena.game_active && in_region(player, arena) {
        broadcast("{player.name} was eliminated!")
    }
}
```

## Installation

### Requirements
- Minecraft Server (Bukkit/Spigot/Paper)
- Java 21 or higher

### Setup
1. Download the latest `Quill.jar` from [Releases](https://github.com/kohanmathers/quill/releases)
2. Place in your server's `plugins/` folder
3. Restart your server
4. Configure in `plugins/Quill/config.yml`

## Usage

### For Admins

Create a scope for a player:
```
/quill scope create <scope_name> <owner_username> <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2>
```

Join a player to a scope (so they're affected by its scripts):
```
/quill scope join <scope_name> <username>
```

Manage permissions:
```
/quill permission revoke <scope_name> <function_name>
/quill permission grant <scope_name> <function_name>
/quill permission list <scope_name>
```

### For Players

Open the in-game editor:
```
/quill edit
```

Load a script file:
```
/quill load <filename>
```

Run/compile your script:
```
/quill run
```

View scope info:
```
/quill info
```
